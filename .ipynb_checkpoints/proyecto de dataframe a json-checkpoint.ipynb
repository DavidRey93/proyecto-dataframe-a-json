This Sauvignon Blanc stand our for its freshness and complexity, mainly marked by citric fruits, such as grapefruit and lime, tropical fruits, and mineral notes.Fresh on the palate, fresh fruits, well-balanced, mineral, good acidity and volume, long finish.',\n",
       "  '2214': 'With the great aromatic intensity typical of a cool-climate wine, this wine shows fresh herb aromas over its fruit. Notes of tomato leaf mingle with fresh green chili (capsicum) and asparagus, all complemented by delicate citrus and mineral traces. On the palate, this is a fresh yet elegant wine with mineral and citrus flavors. The wine has a character that is easy to understand and a pleasure to drink.  ',\n",
       "  '8451': '\"From a granitic slope facing the Pacific Ocean, in the small town of Lo Abarca, this vintage of Cipreses is all about the place - its sharp and severe minerality coming from the soil, its salinity from the sea breezes. Large in scale, ample in flavor and generous in acidity, this is the best Chilean sauvignon of the vintage.\"',\n",
       "  '8454': 'The Laurel Vineyard located on a hillside slope 4 kilometers from the ocean. Very windy area of calcareous and very poor clay soil; never cultivated prior to our plantation. During the winter and fall, morning fog from the ocean lasts until noontime.',\n",

       "  '8476': 'Expressive and elegant with loads of white flower aromas. It is fresh and firm feeling, and it strikes a balance between tropical fruit and vibrant acidity. Pair it with fresh shellfish at the raw bar, lobster rolls, or ceviche.',\n",
       "  '15397': '\"Bold, with lots of spice and toast notes laying over ripe pear tartine, fig and mango flavors.  The fruit stays lush on the finish, while a stony underpinning keeps it all honest\"',\n",

       "  '15521': \"The strong Pacific Ocean influence and red clayish soils concur to foster this refreshing, crisp, pale yellow-green wine. In nose, very fine grapefruit, white flowers and citric hints combine with a perfect mineral character. It's an expressive Sauvignon Blanc, with a mineral and slightly salty mouth, with great acidity and a lovely long finish.\",\n",
       "  '16829': \"Viejas Tinajas comes from the coastal vineyards of the Itata Valley located in the southern region of Chile; it is the cradle of the country's viticulture, with vines dating back to 1551. The area is characterized by a coastal climate, with high levels of rainfall, rolling hills and granite soils. A sustainable agriculture, including dry farming and ploughing with horses are practiced in our vineyards. This wine is fermented and aged in centennial earthenware jars (tinajas or amphorae), thereby rescuing the tradition of the first Chilean vine growers. \",\n",
       "  '21545': \"Very pale and slightly greenish-yellow in colour with aromas of tropical fruit such as cherimoya, notes of green apple, and a nice balance between the fruit and the variety's herbaceous characteristics. The crisp acidity on the fresh palate heightens the tropical notes, although the nose features a more herbal profile. It is medium-bodied and has a pleasing persistence on the finish. \",\n",
       "  '30311': None,\n",
       "  '31810': 'Attractive, brilliant golden-yellow color. Very complex, elegant and clean nose, with tropical fruits, pineapple and asparagus nuances, well married with honey and toasty notes coming from a fine and well integrated wood. Dense, rich and creamy in the mouth, with a well balanced acidity that makes it alive and fresh, with a very pleasant and persisting finish. A Casablanca wine of great personality, involving and filling.',\n",
       "  '31816': 'Bright pale golden yellow with clean light lime notes. Intense fruit aromas mainly sweet citric style such as mandarin and tangerine, with elegant sweet touches of spices and white flowers. Elegant and concentrated. The mouth attack is rich and with a light creaminess, but with a crisp and fresh acidity at the mid palate. Long and pleasant at the finish with more sweet citric aromas.'}}"
